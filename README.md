InternalCacheHandler
====================

Handler along with the demo project to display the UserControl Cache (Webform) and OutputCache which are internal to the .NET Framework

We donâ€™t have an out of box feature to show the internal values of the output cache. I developed an HttpHandler which will show the values of the internal output cache. There are many values inside the internal output cache right now we I am only dealing with the usercontrol output cache and outputcache values(mvc style) and ignoring the rest. Please feel free to extend this project.
